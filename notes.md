scraper (playrwight script, goes to the source, pulls and saves the data to a json)
scrape into the _source_ schema
data that is very close to the site

intake takes the _source_ data and transforms it into a unified schema

end goal:

-   scraper + transformer (final export is standard intake types)
-   report (how you went about scraping)
